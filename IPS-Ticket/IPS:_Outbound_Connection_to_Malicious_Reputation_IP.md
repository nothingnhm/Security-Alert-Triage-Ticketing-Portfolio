## Executive Summary

An IPS alert was reviewed for **Outbound Connection to Malicious Reputation IP** involving VPN-related traffic between external IP **186.23.212.74** and internal VPN infrastructure. Firewall/IPS logs showed **allowed UDP VPN traffic** on port **4500**.

VPN logs identified authentication activity for user **rahul.joshi** in realm **Corporate_VPN**. Authentication was initiated using **Password**, MFA was triggered, OTP was sent, and MFA failed due to **incorrect OTP**. No successful VPN session was confirmed.

The source IP has **100% abuse confidence** and is associated with **Telecentro S.A.** in Argentina. Because authentication reached the MFA stage, possible credential exposure cannot be ruled out until user validation is completed.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **Needs Escalation — Suspicious VPN Authentication Attempt**

The activity is suspicious because VPN authentication was initiated from a malicious reputation IP and reached the MFA stage. The failed OTP prevented confirmed access, but reaching MFA may indicate the correct password was used.

This is **not confirmed compromise** based on the provided evidence. User validation is required before closure.

## Impact Analysis

| Area            | Assessment                                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | No data access observed                                          |
| Integrity       | No unauthorized modification observed                            |
| Availability    | No service disruption reported                                   |
| Business Impact | Potentially moderate/high if user password is exposed            |
| Current Risk    | Elevated until user validation and password status are confirmed |

## Recommended Actions

1. Contact **Rahul Joshi** to confirm whether he attempted VPN login from Argentina.
2. Validate whether VPN authentication succeeded, failed, or timed out.
3. Confirm whether the user received and entered the OTP.
4. If the user denies the activity, reset password, revoke sessions, and require MFA re-registration.
5. Review endpoint **ENDP-084** for EDR alerts or phishing indicators.
6. Review mailbox activity for suspicious inbox rules, forwarding, or sent emails.
7. Block **186.23.212.74** on firewall/IPS/proxy if unauthorized.
8. Validate the asset mismatch between **10.0.2.13** and **10.0.2.12** before final closure.
9. Escalate to SOC L2 if user denial, successful VPN login, endpoint compromise, or mailbox abuse is confirmed.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **User validation required; conditional SOC L2 escalation.**

**Reason:** No successful VPN session was confirmed, but authentication reached MFA from a malicious reputation IP. If Rahul Joshi denies the attempt or suspicious endpoint/mailbox activity is found, escalate to SOC L2 / Incident Response.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-023 — IPS: Outbound Connection to Malicious Reputation IP**. Firewall and IPS logs showed allowed VPN-related traffic involving **186.23.212.74** and internal VPN infrastructure. VPN logs confirmed authentication activity for user **rahul.joshi** in **Corporate_VPN**. MFA OTP was sent and failed due to incorrect OTP; no successful VPN session was confirmed. The source IP has **100% abuse confidence** and is associated with Telecentro S.A. in Argentina. Ticket should remain open pending user validation, VPN result confirmation, and asset mapping review. If user denies the activity, perform password reset, revoke sessions, review endpoint/mailbox activity, and escalate to SOC L2.
