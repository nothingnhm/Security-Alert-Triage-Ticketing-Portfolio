## Executive Summary

A WAF alert was triggered for **Cross-Site Scripting** involving inbound HTTPS traffic from external source IP **45.227.255.2** to internal web server **10.0.2.32 / LinITWebServer01** on **443/TCP**.

The initial request targeted **it.cybersecxperts.com/admin** with an XSS payload attempting JavaScript execution and possible cookie access using `document.cookie`. The initial event showed **Allowed** while the WAF was in **Monitoring** mode; however, the response code was **401**, meaning successful access was not confirmed. Later WAF logs showed repeated XSS attempts from the same source were **Blocked** in **Blocking** mode with HTTP **403**.

No successful XSS execution, session theft, user compromise, application compromise, or service impact was confirmed from the provided evidence.

## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

| Observation           | Result                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Repeated XSS attempts | Observed                                           |
| Targeted paths        | `/admin`, `/api`, `/products`, `/search`, `/login` |
| Initial WAF mode      | Monitoring                                         |
| Later WAF mode        | Blocking                                           |
| Response codes        | 401 / 403                                          |
| Confirmed compromise  | Not Observed                                       |

**Analysis Note:** The first event was logged as **Allowed** because the WAF was in Monitoring mode, but the request returned **401**. Later related requests were blocked with **403**, indicating WAF enforcement was active.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Access    | Exploit Public-Facing Application             | T1190     | XSS payloads targeted public web application paths                  |
| Execution         | Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript | T1059.007 | Payloads attempted JavaScript execution                             |
| Credential Access | Steal Web Session Cookie                      | T1539     | Payloads attempted access to `document.cookie`; theft not confirmed |

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Blocked XSS Attempt**

The alert is valid because WAF logs show repeated XSS payloads attempting JavaScript execution and possible cookie access. The activity targeted multiple web application paths and repeated over several events.

This is **not confirmed compromise**. No successful XSS execution, session theft, account compromise, or service impact was observed.

## Impact Analysis

| Area            | Assessment                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | No cookie/session theft observed                    |
| Integrity       | No application modification confirmed               |
| Availability    | No service disruption reported                      |
| Business Impact | No confirmed impact                                 |
| Current Risk    | Reduced because requests were denied/blocked by WAF |

## Recommended Actions

1. Block source IP **45.227.255.2** at the firewall as per policy.
2. Keep WAF XSS protection in **Blocking** mode.
3. Add **45.227.255.2** to IPS/WAF denylist or watchlist if supported.
4. Review web logs for any similar XSS payloads returning HTTP **200**.
5. Validate whether `PUT` is required on `/admin`, `/products`, `/search`, and `/api`.
6. Disable unnecessary HTTP methods if not required.
7. Review input validation and output encoding on affected paths.
8. Escalate only if script execution, session theft, HTTP 200 response, account compromise, or application compromise is observed.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No SOC L2 escalation required; close after firewall/IPS/WAF rule update.**

**Reason:** The WAF denied/blocked the malicious XSS attempts with HTTP **401/403**, and no successful script execution, session theft, account compromise, application compromise, or service impact was confirmed from the reviewed logs.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-025 — WAF: Cross-Site Scripting**. Inbound HTTPS traffic from **45.227.255.2** to **10.0.2.32 / LinITWebServer01** targeted **it.cybersecxperts.com** with XSS payloads attempting JavaScript execution and cookie access via `document.cookie`. The initial event was allowed while WAF was in Monitoring mode but returned HTTP **401**. Later related events were blocked in Blocking mode with HTTP **403**. No successful XSS execution, session theft, user compromise, application compromise, or service impact was observed. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Denied/Blocked by WAF**, with source IP blocking and WAF/IPS rule enforcement recommended.
