### Attachment Findings

The attachment was identified as malicious by multiple security vendors. The detection category indicates a phishing-related Trojan payload. Because the file is an Excel spreadsheet, the risk includes potential macro execution, malicious embedded content, credential theft, or payload delivery if opened by the user.

#### 4. EDR Review

EDR investigation was performed for the affected users/endpoints.

### EDR Findings

| Check                             | Result       |

| Excel child processes             | Not observed |
| Persistence mechanisms            | Not observed |
| Malware-related endpoint activity | Not observed |
| Endpoint compromise               | Not observed |

The EDR review did not confirm execution of the malicious attachment. No suspicious child processes, persistence, malware behavior, or endpoint compromise were observed from the provided evidence.

#### 5. IPS Review

A historical IPS alert was identified for a similar phishing attachment detection pattern.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic              | Technique                                 | ID        | Reason                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Access      | Phishing                                  | T1566     | Malicious email was delivered to users                                                      |
| Initial Access      | Spearphishing Attachment                  | T1566.001 | Email contained a malicious Excel attachment                                                |
| Execution           | User Execution: Malicious File            | T1204.002 | Execution would require the user to open/run the malicious file; execution was not observed |
| Defense Evasion     | Obfuscated Files or Information           | T1027     | Malicious Office documents may contain hidden payload logic; macro/code review not provided |
| Credential Access   | Input Capture                             | T1056     | Possible if phishing payload was executed; not confirmed                                    |
| Command and Control | Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols | T1071.001 | Possible if payload executed and communicated externally; not confirmed                     |

**MITRE Note:** Only delivery of the malicious attachment was confirmed. Execution, credential access, C2, and endpoint compromise were not observed from the provided evidence.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Malicious Excel Attachment Delivered / No Execution Observed**

The alert is valid because the email delivered a malicious Excel attachment to three internal users. The attachment hash was consistently observed across all recipients and was flagged by **24/64 security vendors** as malicious.

The incident did not progress to confirmed endpoint compromise because EDR investigation found no attachment execution, suspicious process creation, persistence, or malware activity.

This case should be treated as a contained malicious attachment delivery incident, with continued monitoring and user validation required.

## Impact Analysis

| Impact Area                 | Status                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Email Delivery              | Confirmed             |
| Malicious Attachment        | Confirmed             |
| Multiple Users Targeted     | Confirmed             |
| Attachment Hash Identified  | Confirmed             |
| Attachment Execution        | Not Observed          |
| Suspicious Process Creation | Not Observed          |
| Endpoint Compromise         | Not Observed          |
| Credential Theft            | Not Observed          |
| Malware Execution           | Not Observed          |
| Data Exfiltration           | Not Observed          |
| Business Impact             | Low                   |
| User Impact                 | Low to Medium         |
| Residual Risk               | Low after containment |

Current impact: **Malicious attachment delivery confirmed. No execution or endpoint compromise observed.**

## Recommended Actions

1. Quarantine or remove the delivered email from all affected mailboxes.
2. Block sender email `RamirezJ@cityoflakeforest.com` in the email gateway.
3. Block sender domain `cityoflakeforest.com` if no business requirement exists.
4. Block sender IP `52.101.194.18` if policy allows.
5. Add SHA1 hash `2a3a695210d13068a765f03bcd2ae8e3d43006eb` to EDR blocklists.
6. Add sender, sender IP, attachment name, hash, and IPS source IP to SIEM watchlist.
7. Search historical email logs for the same sender, subject, attachment name, and hash.
8. Hunt endpoints for presence of `The City of Lake Forest.xlsx`.
9. Contact affected users and confirm whether the attachment was opened or downloaded.
10. Instruct affected users not to open the attachment, not to enable macros/content, and to report suspicious system behavior.
11. Continue monitoring for similar phishing attachment campaigns.
12. Escalate to SOC L2 / IR if execution or compromise indicators appear.

## User Validation Questions

SOC should contact **Arun Gupta**, **Inaaya Ramachandran**, and **Shalv Keer** and confirm:

1. Did you open the email from `RamirezJ@cityoflakeforest.com`?
2. Did you download or open `The City of Lake Forest.xlsx`?
3. Did Excel show any warning or security prompt?
4. Did you enable macros or click “Enable Content”?
5. Did the file request credentials or open a login page?
6. Did your system show unusual behavior after receiving or opening the email?
7. Did you forward the email or attachment to anyone else?

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No immediate SOC L2 escalation required after containment; conditional escalation if execution or compromise indicators appear.**

**Reason:** The attachment was confirmed malicious, but there was no evidence of execution, endpoint compromise, credential theft, malware activity, or data exfiltration from the provided logs.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Incident Response** if any of the following are identified:

1. User opened or executed the attachment.
2. Excel spawned suspicious child processes.
3. Macros or embedded content were enabled.
4. EDR detects malware execution.
5. Network callback activity is observed.
6. Credential theft indicators are identified.
7. Additional users receive or execute the file.
8. Persistence or lateral movement indicators are found.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-0239 — Phishing Email** reported by **Arun Gupta**. The email was sent from `RamirezJ@cityoflakeforest.com` with the subject **City of Lake Forest 2025-02-12 - Sign order# 09098897-GP - PI - INVo. 24ST CV33846 - AIR130259**. Email gateway logs confirmed delivery to `arun.gupta@abc.com`, `inaaya.ramachandran@abc.com`, and `shalv.keer@abc.com`. The attachment was `The City of Lake Forest.xlsx` with SHA1 hash `2a3a695210d13068a765f03bcd2ae8e3d43006eb`. Reputation analysis confirmed the attachment as malicious, with **24/64 security vendors** flagging it as a Trojan / phishing payload. EDR investigation found no attachment execution, suspicious process creation, persistence, malware-related endpoint activity, or endpoint compromise. IPS review identified a historical detection for a similar phishing payload, but no active exploitation or related malicious communication was observed. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Malicious Excel Attachment Delivered / No Execution Observed**, with email quarantine, sender/IP/hash blocking, EDR hash blocklisting, user notification, IOC hunting, and continued monitoring recommended.
