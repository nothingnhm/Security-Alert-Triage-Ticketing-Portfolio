| Analyst Decision | **True Positive — SharePoint-Themed Phishing Email with User Interaction and Possible Credential Submission** |

## Executive Summary

An email gateway alert was triggered for suspicious external emails targeting corporate mailboxes. The campaign used a **Microsoft SharePoint / purchase order** theme to trick users into opening a phishing URL.

The primary sender observed was:

`Microsoft Sharepoint <dariana@trangthino.cfd>`

The emails were delivered to multiple recipients:

* `ajay.joshi@abc.com`
* `david.patel@abc.com`
* `info@abc.com`

The email contained a suspicious GitHub Pages-hosted URL under:

`jjjjjefta.github.io`

The phishing URL was categorized as a **Security Risk** and classified as **Phishing**. A related earlier suspicious SharePoint-themed email was also observed from:

`Noreply@abc.com`

This related email contained a Glitch-hosted URL:

`bird-rattle-sundial.glitch.me`

Proxy logs confirmed that user **David Patel** accessed the suspicious `jjjjjefta.github.io` domain using a **GET** request and later submitted a **POST** request. The POST request returned HTTP **200**, which may indicate form submission or possible credential entry.

Based on the external sender, SharePoint impersonation, purchase order lure, phishing URL reputation, delivered email status, and confirmed POST activity, this case is assessed as a **true positive phishing incident with user interaction and possible credential submission**.

## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

### Investigation Flow

#### 1. Alert Review

The alert was reviewed as a suspicious external email targeting corporate domains. The campaign used the trusted brand name **Microsoft SharePoint** and a purchase order theme, which is commonly used in phishing campaigns to make users open links or documents.

Key suspicious indicators:

| Indicator          | Observation               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Display Name       | Microsoft Sharepoint      |
| Sender Domain      | trangthino.cfd            |
| Brand Theme        | Microsoft SharePoint      |
| Email Theme        | Purchase Order            |
| Email Status       | Delivered                 |
| Gateway Action     | allowed                   |
| URL Hosting        | GitHub Pages              |
| URL Classification | Phishing                  |
| User Interaction   | Confirmed for David Patel |
| POST Request       | Observed                  |

#### 2. Sender and Brand Impersonation Review

The sender used the display name **Microsoft Sharepoint**, but the actual sender address was:

`dariana@trangthino.cfd`

This sender domain does not match Microsoft or the organization. The mismatch between display name and sender domain is a strong phishing indicator.

#### 3. Email Delivery Validation

Email gateway logs confirmed that similar SharePoint-themed emails were delivered to multiple corporate recipients.

```spl id="cs0234_email_query"

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — SharePoint-Themed Phishing Email with User Interaction**

The alert is valid because the email impersonated Microsoft SharePoint, used purchase order references, targeted multiple corporate recipients, and delivered phishing URLs hosted on GitHub Pages. The phishing URL was categorized as a security risk and classified as phishing.

The highest-risk evidence is the **POST** request from **David Patel**, which may indicate form or credential submission. However, the exact submitted data is not visible from proxy logs.

No successful account compromise, MFA approval, suspicious VPN/login activity, malware download, endpoint compromise, or data exfiltration was confirmed from the provided evidence.

Current impact: **User interaction confirmed for David Patel. Credential submission is possible due to POST activity, but account compromise is not confirmed.**

## Recommended Actions

1. Contact **David Patel** immediately and confirm whether credentials, OTP, MFA code, or sensitive information were entered.
2. Reset David Patel’s password as a precaution due to POST activity.
3. Revoke active sessions and refresh tokens for David Patel.
4. Review authentication, VPN, and MFA logs for David Patel after **2024-04-24 09:16:00**.
5. Review mailbox forwarding rules and inbox rules for David Patel if credential submission is confirmed.
6. Contact **Ajay Joshi** and the owner of `info@abc.com` to confirm whether the phishing URL was clicked.
7. Quarantine/remove delivered emails from all affected mailboxes.
8. Search all mailboxes for the same sender, subject pattern, URLs, sender IP, and sender domain.
9. Block `dariana@trangthino.cfd` in the email gateway.
10. Block or quarantine emails from `trangthino.cfd`.
11. Block `jjjjjefta.github.io` in proxy/SWG and DNS security.
12. Block `bird-rattle-sundial.glitch.me` in proxy/SWG and DNS security.
13. Block destination IP `185.199.109.153` only if policy allows and business impact is reviewed.
14. Add all IOCs to SIEM watchlists and correlation rules.
15. Monitor affected users for **2–3 days** after containment.

**Blocking Note:** Since GitHub Pages and Glitch can be used for legitimate hosting, avoid broad blocking of all `github.io` or `glitch.me` unless policy approves. Prefer blocking the exact malicious subdomains and full URL paths.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **Conditional escalation to SOC L2 / Identity Team.**

**Reason:** The phishing email was delivered to multiple users, and David Patel interacted with the phishing URL using both GET and POST requests. The POST request creates a credible risk of credential submission.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Identity Team** if any of the following are confirmed:

1. David Patel entered corporate credentials.
2. David Patel entered OTP or approved MFA.
3. Suspicious authentication activity is found.
4. Mailbox forwarding or suspicious inbox rules are created.
5. Additional users clicked the phishing URL.
6. Endpoint compromise indicators are identified.
7. Phishing emails remain in user mailboxes.
8. Similar campaign activity continues.

If David confirms no credentials were entered and authentication logs are clean, close after mailbox cleanup, IOC blocking, and monitoring documentation.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-0234 — Email Gateway: Detection of Suspicious External Emails Targeting Corporate Domains**. The campaign used a Microsoft SharePoint and purchase order theme and was sent from `Microsoft Sharepoint <dariana@trangthino.cfd>`. Email gateway logs confirmed delivery to `ajay.joshi@abc.com`, `david.patel@abc.com`, and `info@abc.com`. The emails contained phishing URLs hosted on `jjjjjefta.github.io`. A related earlier SharePoint-themed suspicious email used `bird-rattle-sundial.glitch.me`. Proxy logs confirmed that **David Patel** accessed `jjjjjefta.github.io` and performed both GET and POST requests with HTTP response code 200. The POST request creates a possible credential submission risk. No successful account compromise, MFA approval, endpoint compromise, malware download, or data exfiltration was confirmed from the provided logs. Ticket closed as **True Positive — SharePoint-Themed Phishing Email with User Interaction and Possible Credential Submission**, with email quarantine, IOC blocking, David Patel user validation, password/session review, authentication log review, and conditional SOC L2/Identity Team escalation recommended if credential submission or suspicious login activity is confirmed.
