| Analyst Decision | **True Positive — Phishing Campaign with Possible Credential Harvesting / MFA-Protected VPN Attempts Blocked** |

## Executive Summary

A phishing email alert was reported by **Sneha Rathod**. The email used a financial/remittance-themed subject and was delivered to multiple users.

The suspicious email appeared to come from:

`No Reply Via Xerox Scanner <reb@tonmercer.org>`

The subject was:

`Distribution Remittance 84,300.09 Process_Ref.3hdhbsnn34n24jszmfbshn4vahdeh4`

The email contained a URL hosted under **growthzoneapp.com**. Email authentication checks showed **SPF Pass**, **DKIM Pass**, and **DMARC Pass**. Reputation checks showed the domain as legitimate in the provided sources. However, email authentication and legitimate domain reputation do not prove the email is safe because attackers may abuse trusted third-party platforms, compromised accounts, or legitimate infrastructure.

Proxy logs confirmed that multiple users accessed the GrowthZoneApp domain. Several users generated **POST** requests with HTTP **200** responses, indicating possible form submission. VPN logs later showed authentication attempts from suspicious source IP **185.7.214.37** against impacted users. MFA challenges were triggered and failed due to incorrect OTP entries. No successful VPN session was observed.

This case is assessed as a **True Positive phishing campaign with possible credential harvesting**, where MFA prevented full VPN compromise.

## Investigation Flow

### 1. Alert Review

The alert was reviewed as a phishing email incident because the email used a financial/remittance lure and included an external URL. Although SPF, DKIM, and DMARC passed, the subject, link behavior, multiple recipient scope, and follow-up VPN activity made the case high risk.

### 2. Email Delivery Validation

Email logs confirmed that the suspicious email was **Delivered** and **Allowed**. This means the message reached user mailboxes and required containment through email quarantine/removal.

### 3. URL and Domain Analysis

The phishing URL used **growthzoneapp.com**, a domain reported as legitimate in the provided reputation checks. The key risk was not domain reputation alone but suspected abuse of a trusted third-party platform to host or redirect users to a phishing form.

### 4. Proxy Access Validation

Proxy logs confirmed that multiple users accessed **growthzoneapp.com** after the email was delivered. GET requests confirmed page access. POST requests from **Brian Lee**, **Rakesh Chauhan**, and **Sneha Khanna** increased the risk because POST traffic may indicate form submission.

### 5. VPN Correlation

VPN logs showed suspicious authentication attempts from **185.7.214.37** against users who interacted with the phishing domain. MFA challenges were initiated and failed. No successful VPN session was observed.

### 7. Attack Chain Correlation

The evidence supports the following attack chain:

1. Phishing email was delivered to multiple users.
2. Multiple users accessed the phishing-related domain.
3. POST requests were observed from selected users, indicating possible submitted data.
4. VPN authentication attempts followed from suspicious IP **185.7.214.37**.
5. MFA challenges were triggered.
6. MFA challenges failed due to incorrect OTP entries.
7. No successful VPN session was confirmed.

This sequence is consistent with phishing-driven credential harvesting followed by attempted VPN login using harvested credentials.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Phishing Campaign with Possible Credential Harvesting**

The alert is valid because the email was delivered, multiple users accessed the linked domain, POST requests were observed, and suspicious VPN authentication attempts followed from an external IP.

MFA prevented successful VPN access, but possible credential exposure cannot be ruled out. The users with POST activity and VPN MFA failures should be treated as high-risk impacted accounts.

## Recommended Actions

1. Isolate impacted endpoints for users with POST activity and VPN MFA failures.
2. Reset passwords for **Brian Lee**, **Sneha Khanna**, and **Rakesh Chauhan**.
3. Revoke active sessions and tokens for high-risk impacted users.
4. Review MFA logs for all impacted users.
5. Quarantine or remove the phishing email from all recipient mailboxes.
6. Block the phishing URL paths in email gateway, proxy, and IPS.
7. Block **185.7.214.37** in firewall, VPN, and IPS controls.
8. Block **248.192.27.119** in firewall and IPS as the provided IPS-detected IOC.
9. Block **172.170.249.2** if no business requirement exists.
10. Treat **52.101.10.18** cautiously because it is the email sender IP; block only if policy confirms it as malicious or not business-required.
11. Hunt for additional users who accessed the same URL or generated POST requests.
12. Escalate to SOC L2 / Incident Response for credential exposure investigation.

## Containment / Blocking Plan

| Control              | Indicator                          | Recommended Action                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Email Gateway        | `reb@tonmercer.org`      | Quarantine/block if not business-required            |
| Email Gateway        | `princetonmercer.org`              | Add to watchlist; block only if policy approves      |
| Email Gateway        | GrowthZoneApp phishing URL paths   | Block/quarantine                                     |
| Proxy / SWG          | GrowthZoneApp phishing URL path    | Block                                                |
| IPS                  | GrowthZoneApp phishing URL pattern | Add detection/block rule                             |
| Firewall / IPS       | 172.170.249.2                      | Block outbound if not business-required              |
| Firewall / IPS       | 52.101.10.18                       | Block only if confirmed malicious or policy-approved |
| Firewall / VPN / IPS | 185.7.214.37                       | Block immediately                                    |
| Firewall / IPS       | 248.192.27.119                     | Block as provided IOC                                |
| SIEM                 | All IOCs and impacted users        | Add to watchlist and correlation rules               |

**Blocking Note:** Since **growthzoneapp.com** may be a legitimate third-party platform, broad domain blocking may cause business impact. Prefer blocking exact phishing URL paths and the related subdomain unless policy approves full domain blocking.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **Escalate to SOC L2 / Incident Response.**

**Reason:** This case involves phishing email delivery, multiple user interactions, POST requests, and suspicious VPN authentication attempts from **185.7.214.37**. Even though MFA blocked successful VPN access, credential exposure cannot be ruled out.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-046 — Phishing Email**. The phishing email was reported by **Sneha Rathod** and used a remittance-themed subject. The email was sent from `reb@tonmercer.org` with display name **No Reply Via Xerox Scanner** and contained a GrowthZoneApp URL. Email authentication checks showed SPF, DKIM, and DMARC passed; however, proxy logs confirmed multiple users accessed **growthzoneapp.com**, and POST requests were observed for **Brian Lee**, **Rakesh Chauhan**, and **Sneha Khanna**. VPN logs then showed suspicious authentication attempts from **185.7.214.37**, with MFA challenges initiated and failed due to incorrect OTP entries. No successful VPN session, malware download, endpoint compromise, or data exfiltration was confirmed. The incident is assessed as **True Positive — Phishing Campaign with Possible Credential Harvesting / MFA-Protected VPN Attempts Blocked**. Recommended containment includes endpoint isolation, password resets, session revocation, phishing email quarantine, URL/domain path blocking, and firewall/IPS/VPN blocking for identified malicious IPs.
