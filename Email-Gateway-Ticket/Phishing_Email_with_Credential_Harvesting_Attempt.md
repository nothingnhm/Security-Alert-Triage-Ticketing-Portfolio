## Executive Summary

A phishing email campaign was reported by **Brian Lee** for analysis. The email used a financial remittance theme and attempted to lure users into opening a suspicious URL hosted through legitimate third-party infrastructure.

The phishing email was sent from:

`No Reply Via Xerox Scanner <rebecca@princetonmercer.org>`

The subject was:

`Distribution Remittance 84,300.09 Process_Ref.3hdhbsnn34n24jszmfbshn4vahdeh4`

The embedded URL was:

`https://princetonmercerregionalchamberofcommerce.growthzoneapp.com/ap/r/99a0a6caa8a74d3b9e2e07ecc4ce9bf1`

Email gateway logs confirmed that the email was delivered to **seven internal users**. Proxy logs confirmed that multiple users accessed the phishing URL. Repeated user interaction was observed for **Brian Lee**, **Sneha Khanna**, and **Rakesh Chauhan**. POST activity was also observed during the investigation, indicating possible credential or form submission.

Following the user interaction, suspicious VPN authentication attempts were observed from external IP:

`185.7.214.37`

The VPN attempts reached the password authentication stage and triggered MFA challenges. MFA validation failed, and no successful VPN session was established.

Based on the delivered phishing email, multiple user interactions, possible credential submission, and suspicious VPN MFA failures, this incident is assessed as a **true positive credential-harvesting phishing attempt**. MFA prevented unauthorized VPN access. No endpoint compromise, malware execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was confirmed from the provided evidence.

### Source Analysis

The sender infrastructure belongs to **SendGrid**, a legitimate email delivery service. The phishing campaign appears to have abused trusted third-party email infrastructure to improve delivery success and reduce the chance of reputation-based blocking.

The use of legitimate infrastructure does not make the email benign. The final assessment is based on the message theme, user interaction, URL behavior, and VPN correlation.

#### 6. Attack Chain Correlation

The evidence supports the following attack chain:

1. Financial remittance-themed phishing email was delivered to seven users.
2. The email used trusted third-party infrastructure to increase delivery success.
3. Multiple users accessed the embedded GrowthZone URL.
4. Repeated user interaction was observed for Brian Lee, Sneha Khanna, and Rakesh Chauhan.
5. POST activity was observed during investigation, indicating possible credential or form submission.
6. Suspicious VPN authentication attempts began from external IP `185.7.214.37`.
7. VPN login attempts reached the MFA stage.
8. MFA failed and prevented successful VPN access.
9. No endpoint compromise, malware execution, or data exfiltration was observed.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic              | Technique                                      | ID        | Reason                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Access      | Phishing                                       | T1566     | Phishing email was delivered to multiple users                |
| Initial Access      | Spearphishing Link                             | T1566.002 | Email contained a link to suspicious hosted infrastructure    |
| Credential Access   | Input Capture                                  | T1056     | POST activity may indicate submitted credentials or form data |

| Credential Access   | Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation | T1621     | MFA challenges and OTP prompts were generated                 |
| Command and Control | Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols      | T1071.001 | Users accessed phishing infrastructure over web protocols     |

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Credential Harvesting Attempt**

The alert is valid because the email was delivered to seven internal users, multiple users accessed the embedded URL, repeated proxy activity was observed, and suspicious VPN authentication attempts followed from `185.7.214.37`.

The activity strongly suggests credential harvesting or attempted credential abuse. MFA prevented unauthorized VPN access because all MFA attempts failed and no successful VPN session was observed.

This is not confirmed endpoint compromise because no malware execution, endpoint alert, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was identified from the provided logs.

## Impact Analysis

| Impact Area                  | Status                        |

| Malware execution            | Not Observed                  |
| Data exfiltration            | Not Observed                  |
| Business impact              | Low to Medium                 |

Current impact: **Credential exposure risk is high, but MFA prevented confirmed unauthorized VPN access. No endpoint or data impact was confirmed.**

## Recommended Actions

1. Reset passwords for users with repeated proxy access and likely credential exposure:

   * Brian Lee
   * Sneha Khanna
   * Rakesh Chauhan
2. Revoke active sessions and refresh tokens for impacted users.
3. Review VPN, MFA, and authentication logs for all users who clicked the phishing URL.
4. Block suspicious VPN source IP `185.7.214.37` in VPN, firewall, and IPS controls.
5. Block the phishing URL path in proxy/SWG controls.
6. Block sender email `rebecca@princetonmercer.org` in the email gateway.
7. Block sender domain `princetonmercer.org` if no business requirement exists.
8. Search and quarantine/remove related emails from all affected mailboxes.
9. Add all IOCs to SIEM watchlists and correlation rules.
10. Contact affected users and confirm whether credentials, OTP, or MFA details were entered.
11. Review mailbox forwarding rules and inbox rules if credential entry is confirmed.
12. Monitor impacted users for **2–3 days** after containment.
13. Escalate to SOC L2 / Identity Team if successful login, MFA approval, mailbox rule creation, or endpoint compromise indicators are found.

**Blocking Note:** Since `growthzoneapp.com` may host legitimate third-party content, avoid broad global blocking unless approved. Prefer blocking the specific malicious URL/path and related sender indicators.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **Closed after containment; conditional SOC L2 escalation if additional compromise indicators appear.**

**Reason:** Credential harvesting is likely due to user interaction and suspicious VPN attempts. However, MFA prevented successful VPN access, and no endpoint compromise, malware execution, or data exfiltration was observed.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Identity Team** if any of the following are identified:

1. Successful VPN login from suspicious IP.
2. MFA approval from unknown location.
3. Suspicious mailbox forwarding rule creation.
4. Suspicious OAuth consent activity.
5. Endpoint compromise indicators.
6. Additional credential use from external IPs.
7. Data exfiltration indicators.
8. Additional users confirm credential submission.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-058 — Phishing Email with Credential Harvesting Attempt** reported by **Brian Lee**. The phishing email was sent from `rebecca@princetonmercer.org` with the subject **Distribution Remittance 84,300.09 Process_Ref.3hdhbsnn34n24jszmfbshn4vahdeh4**. Email gateway logs confirmed delivery to seven internal users: `myra.raju@abc.com`, `william.rao@abc.com`, `ajay.collins@abc.com`, `samuel.jain@abc.com`, `rakesh.chauhan@abc.com`, `sneha.khanna@abc.com`, and `brian.lee@abc.com`. The embedded URL used GrowthZone infrastructure and pointed to `https://princetonmercerregionalchamberofcommerce.growthzoneapp.com/ap/r/99a0a6caa8a74d3b9e2e07ecc4ce9bf1`. Proxy logs confirmed multiple users accessed the phishing page, with repeated activity for Brian Lee, Sneha Khanna, and Rakesh Chauhan. POST activity was observed during investigation, indicating possible credential submission. Suspicious VPN authentication attempts were later observed from `185.7.214.37`, where password authentication was initiated, MFA challenges were generated, OTP prompts were sent, and MFA failed. No successful VPN session, endpoint compromise, malware execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was confirmed. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Credential Harvesting Attempt / MFA Prevented Unauthorized VPN Access**, with password reset, session revocation, phishing email quarantine, IOC blocking, user awareness, and 2–3 days of monitoring recommended.
