| Analyst Decision     | **True Positive — Credential Harvesting Phishing with Possible Credential Submission / MFA Prevented VPN Access** |

## Executive Summary

User **Rachel Moore** reported a suspicious email for analysis. The email used an urgent account-verification theme with the subject:

`URGENT: confirm account activity`

The email impersonated account security activity and was delivered to multiple internal recipients:

* `rahul.joshi@abc.com`
* `rachel.moore@abc.com`
* `info@abc.com`

The phishing email used a redirect path through:

`secure.adnxs.com`

and redirected users to the credential-harvesting domain:

`maxloglogistica.com`

Email gateway logs confirmed that the phishing email was delivered to three recipients. Proxy logs confirmed that **Rahul Joshi** accessed the phishing URL using **GET** and then submitted a **POST** request. The POST request returned HTTP **200**, which indicates possible form or credential submission. **Rachel Moore** accessed the phishing page using **GET**, but no POST activity was observed for her in the provided evidence.

VPN logs showed suspicious authentication attempts for **Rahul Joshi** from external IP:

`186.23.212.74`

The authentication flow reached the MFA stage, OTP was sent, and MFA failed. No successful VPN session was established. Based on the available evidence, MFA prevented unauthorized VPN access.

No endpoint compromise, malware execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was confirmed from the provided logs.

#### 6. Timeline Reconstruction

| Time                | Event                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2025-02-23 08:29:00 | Suspicious VPN authentication attempts observed for Rahul Joshi from `186.23.212.74`      |
| 2025-02-24 10:39:00 | Phishing email delivered to Rahul Joshi, Rachel Moore, and info mailbox                   |
| 2025-02-24 10:39:00 | Rachel Moore accessed the phishing URL using GET                                          |
| 2025-02-24 11:45:00 | Rahul Joshi accessed the phishing URL using GET                                           |
| 2025-02-24 11:46:00 | Rahul Joshi submitted POST request to phishing URL; possible credential submission        |
| Investigation Time  | IOC blocking, password reset, session termination, and user awareness actions recommended |

**Timestamp Note:** VPN activity is dated **2025-02-23**, while phishing email and proxy activity occurred on **2025-02-24**. This may indicate timezone/log normalization differences, copied timestamp mismatch, or a separate suspicious authentication event. The VPN activity should still be reviewed because it targeted Rahul Joshi from an external source IP and included MFA failure.

#### 7. Attack Chain Correlation

The evidence supports the following attack chain:

1. Phishing email was delivered to multiple recipients.
2. Email used urgent account activity wording.
3. Link redirected through secure.adnxs.com.
4. Final destination was maxloglogistica.com.
5. Rachel Moore accessed the phishing URL using GET.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Credential Harvesting Phishing with Possible Credential Submission**

The alert is valid because the suspicious email was delivered to multiple recipients, redirected users to a credential-harvesting domain, and proxy logs confirmed user interaction.

Rahul Joshi’s **POST** request to the phishing page is the highest-risk evidence and indicates possible credential or form submission. Suspicious VPN authentication attempts from **186.23.212.74** further increase the risk. MFA blocked unauthorized VPN access, and no successful VPN session was confirmed.

Rachel Moore clicked the phishing page, but no POST request or credential submission evidence was observed for her from the provided logs.

## Impact Analysis

| Impact Area                            | Status        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Phishing email delivered               | Confirmed     |
| Multiple recipients targeted           | Confirmed     |
| Rahul Joshi accessed phishing page     | Confirmed     |
| Rahul Joshi POST request observed      | Confirmed     |
| Possible credential submission         | Possible      |
| Rachel Moore accessed phishing page    | Confirmed     |
| Suspicious VPN attempt for Rahul Joshi | Confirmed     |
| MFA challenge generated                | Confirmed     |
| MFA failed                             | Confirmed     |
| Successful VPN access                  | Not Confirmed |
| Malware execution                      | Not Confirmed |
| Endpoint compromise                    | Not Confirmed |
| Lateral movement                       | Not Confirmed |
| Data exfiltration                      | Not Confirmed |

Current impact: **Credential exposure is possible for Rahul Joshi. MFA prevented confirmed VPN account takeover. No endpoint or data impact was confirmed.**

## Recommended Actions

1. Reset Rahul Joshi’s password due to POST activity and possible credential submission.
2. Revoke active sessions and refresh tokens for Rahul Joshi.
3. Review Rahul Joshi’s VPN, MFA, and authentication logs before and after the event.
4. Block suspicious VPN source IP `186.23.212.74` in VPN, firewall, and IPS controls.
5. Block phishing domains and URLs related to `secure.adnxs.com` redirect chain and `maxloglogistica.com`.
6. Remove/quarantine delivered phishing emails from all affected mailboxes.
7. Search for additional recipients of the same sender, subject, and URL.
8. Contact Rahul Joshi and confirm whether credentials, OTP, MFA code, or sensitive data were entered.
9. Contact Rachel Moore and confirm whether she clicked the link and entered any information.
10. Review mailbox forwarding rules and inbox rules for Rahul Joshi if credential submission is confirmed.
11. Add all IOCs and affected users to SIEM watchlists and correlation rules.
12. Monitor Rahul Joshi and Rachel Moore for **2–3 days** after containment.
13. Escalate to SOC L2 / Identity Team if suspicious authentication, credential compromise, or additional impacted users are identified.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **Closed after containment; conditional SOC L2 escalation if further suspicious activity is observed.**

**Reason:** Rahul Joshi interacted with the phishing site and generated a POST request, creating possible credential exposure risk. However, MFA prevented successful VPN access, and no endpoint compromise, malware activity, or data exfiltration was identified from the provided logs.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Identity Team** if any of the following are found:

1. Successful login from suspicious IP.
2. MFA approval from an unknown location.
3. Suspicious mailbox forwarding rules.
4. Suspicious OAuth consent activity.
5. Endpoint compromise indicators.
6. Additional credential use from external IPs.
7. Data exfiltration indicators.
8. Additional users submit credentials.

The submitted email used the subject **URGENT: confirm account activity** and was delivered to `rahul.joshi@abc.com`, `rachel.moore@abc.com`, and `info@abc.com`. The phishing URL redirected through `secure.adnxs.com` and led to the credential-harvesting domain `maxloglogistica.com`. Proxy logs confirmed that **Rahul Joshi** accessed the phishing page using GET and generated a POST request, indicating possible credential or form submission. **Rachel Moore** accessed the phishing page using GET, but no POST activity was observed for her. VPN logs showed suspicious authentication attempts for Rahul Joshi from `186.23.212.74`, where password authentication was initiated, MFA challenge was generated, OTP was sent, and MFA failed. No successful VPN session, endpoint compromise, malware execution, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was confirmed. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Credential Harvesting Phishing with Possible Credential Submission / MFA Prevented VPN Access**, with password reset, session revocation, phishing email quarantine, IOC blocking, user awareness, and 2–3 days of monitoring recommended.
