## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

### Investigation Flow

#### 1. Alert Review

The alert was reviewed as a user-reported suspicious email. Since the user submitted an `.eml` file, the investigation focused on sender legitimacy, email authentication, URL behavior, attachments, delivery scope, and any user interaction.

Key review points:

| Check                | Result                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Sender identity      | Freshworks marketing sender                |
| Email theme          | AI-powered customer support tool marketing |
| Attachment           | None                                       |
| URL                  | Freshworks tracking redirect to Calendly   |
| Credential request   | Not observed                               |
| Malicious redirect   | Not observed                               |
| Proxy click activity | Not observed                               |
| Endpoint impact      | Not observed                               |

#### 2. Email Authentication Review

| Control | Result | Analyst Interpretation                |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| SPF     | Pass   | Sending infrastructure was authorized |
| DKIM    | Fail   | Body hash mismatch observed           |
| DMARC   | Pass   | Domain alignment passed               |

The DKIM failure alone does not confirm phishing. DKIM body hash failures can occur due to message modification, forwarding, email security processing, or marketing platform formatting changes. Since SPF and DMARC passed and no malicious indicators were found, the DKIM result was treated as a non-blocking anomaly.

#### 3. URL Review

The embedded URL redirected through Freshworks tracking infrastructure to a Calendly meeting page.

| Field                 | Value                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Tracking Domain       | fwtrackinte.freshworks.com                |
| Effective URL         | `https://calendly.com/ashlyn-saju-/30min` |
| Domains Identified    | freshworks.com, calendly.com              |
| Malicious Redirects   | Not Observed                              |
| Phishing Page         | Not Observed                              |
| Credential Harvesting | Not Observed                              |
| URL Risk              | Benign                                    |

The URL behavior was consistent with normal marketing email tracking and meeting scheduling activity.

#### 4. Body and Attachment Review

| Check               | Result       |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| Attachment Present  | No           |
| Executable Content  | No           |
| Credential Request  | No           |
| Malicious Link      | No           |
| Phishing Page       | Not observed |
| Suspicious Download | Not observed |
| Marketing Content   | Yes          |

The email content promoted AI-powered customer support solutions and encouraged recipients to schedule a meeting. No phishing form, credential prompt, malicious attachment, or suspicious payload was identified.

#### 5. Email Log Review

```spl id="cs0236_email_query"
index=main "ashl.hacker@works.com" sourcetype=email_logs
| table _time Sender Recipient Status URL Attachment_Name Email_Subject MessageID
```

2025-03-03 23:56:00	ashl.hacker@works.com	hr@abc.com	Delivered	Still Searching for the Perfect AI-Powered Customer Support Tool?
```

#### 6. Proxy Log Review

No proxy events were identified for the embedded URL.

Proxy findings:

| Check                                            | Result       |

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic | Technique | ID  | Reason                                                                                  |
| ------ | --------- | --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N/A    | N/A       | N/A | No malicious behavior confirmed                                                         |
| N/A    | N/A       | N/A | No phishing, malware delivery, credential harvesting, or compromise indicators observed |

**MITRE Note:** No ATT&CK technique is assigned because the investigation did not confirm adversary behavior.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **False Positive — Legitimate Marketing Email**

The reported email does not show malicious characteristics. The sender domain was consistent with Freshworks, the email content was marketing-related, no attachment was present, and the embedded link redirected to a Calendly scheduling page.

SPF and DMARC passed. DKIM failed, but the failure was not enough to classify the email as malicious because no supporting suspicious behavior was found.

No user click activity, credential submission, suspicious proxy traffic, endpoint compromise, or account compromise was identified.

## Impact Analysis

| Impact Area          | Status      |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Malware Infection    | No Evidence |
| Credential Theft     | No Evidence |
| User Interaction     | No Evidence |
| Data Exposure        | No Evidence |
| System Compromise    | No Evidence |
| Endpoint Impact      | No Evidence |
| Account Compromise   | No Evidence |
| Phishing Campaign    | No Evidence |
| Malicious Attachment | No Evidence |
| Malicious Redirect   | No Evidence |

Current impact: **No security impact identified.**

## Recommended Actions

1. No sender block is required.
2. No domain block is required for `freshworks.com` or `calendly.com`.
3. No password reset is required.
4. No endpoint isolation is required.
5. No SOC L2 escalation is required.
6. Inform the reporting user that the email appears to be legitimate marketing communication.
7. Optionally remove the email if the recipient considers it unwanted marketing/spam.
8. Continue standard monitoring for future suspicious emails.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No escalation required.**

**Reason:** The email was determined to be legitimate marketing communication. No malicious attachments, phishing URLs, credential harvesting pages, suspicious redirects, endpoint alerts, user clicks, or compromise indicators were identified.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

The reported email was sent from `ashl.hacker@works.com` to `hr@abc.com` and `meera.sharma@abc.com` with the subject **Still Searching for the Perfect AI-Powered Customer Support Tool?**.
