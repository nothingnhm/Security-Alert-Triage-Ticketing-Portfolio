## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

### Investigation Flow

#### 1. Alert Review

SOC reviewed the Linux port scanning alert for host `LinFDWebServer04`. The alert triggered because `nmap` usage was detected on a Linux server.

Nmap activity can be suspicious because attackers commonly use scanning tools to identify live hosts, open ports, and exposed services during reconnaissance.

#### 2. Entity Identification

| Entity         | Value                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Hostname       | LinFDWebServer04        |
| Host IP        | 10.0.11.8               |
| OS             | Linux - RHEL 8          |

1. The command was executed by `Eva Johnson`, a Linux Admin.
2. The source address `10.1.0.21` appears to be an internal/admin source.
3. The command targeted an internal subnet.
4. The scan command did not include malicious payload execution.
5. No unauthorized user context was observed.
6. No suspicious file modification was observed.
7. No suspicious account creation was observed.
8. No privilege escalation was observed.
9. No external attacker source was identified.
10. No compromise indicator was present in the provided logs.

Current assessment: **Authorized internal scanning or troubleshooting activity / no malicious activity observed.**

2. Maintain change/task references for internal port scanning.
3. Confirm `10.1.0.21` is an approved admin workstation or jump host.
4. Ensure only approved administrators can run network scanning tools from production servers.
5. Restrict scanning activity to approved maintenance windows where possible.
6. Monitor for Nmap usage by non-admin users.
7. Alert on Nmap scans targeting sensitive network ranges.
8. Alert on scans followed by suspicious activity such as SSH brute force, file modification, account creation, download commands, or exploitation attempts.
9. Tune detection logic to include user role and approved admin source addresses.
10. Periodically review network scanning activity for policy compliance.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No escalation required.**

**Reason:** The Nmap scan was executed by a Linux Admin, from an internal source address, and no malicious follow-up activity was observed in the provided logs. The alert is assessed as authorized administrative activity.

Escalation would be required only if:

1. Eva Johnson denies performing the scan.
2. Source address `10.1.0.21` is not approved.
3. The scan was not authorized.
4. Scanning was followed by suspicious login attempts or exploitation.
5. Similar scans are observed from unknown or non-admin users.
6. The scan targets restricted or sensitive systems without approval.
