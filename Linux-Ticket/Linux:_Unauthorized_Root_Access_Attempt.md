| Analyst Decision  | **True Positive — Unauthorized Root SSH Access Attempt / No Successful Login Observed** |

## Executive Summary

A Linux security alert was triggered on **LinFDWebServer04** after SSH login attempts were observed against the privileged `root` account.

The affected server was:

`LinFDWebServer04 / 10.0.11.8`

The SSH login attempts originated from the external source IP:

`137.74.181.244`

The source IP had **100% abuse confidence** and was associated with **OVH SAS**, a data center / web hosting / transit provider located in France.

Splunk logs confirmed failed SSH pre-authentication attempts against the `root` account at **2025-05-12 13:15** and **2025-05-12 13:20**. Both events showed `success=no` and `res=failed`.

No successful root login, privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, or data exfiltration was observed in the provided logs.

Final assessment: **True Positive unauthorized root SSH access attempt. The source IP was blocked/recommended for blocking, and the ticket was closed after confirming no successful SSH authentication or compromise from the provided evidence.**

### Source IP Assessment

The source IP `137.74.181.244` had **100% abuse confidence** and belonged to data center / hosting infrastructure. SSH attempts against the `root` account from a high-risk external hosting IP are suspicious and commonly associated with automated scanning, brute-force attempts, or credential guessing.

Even though only two failed attempts were observed in the provided logs, any direct SSH attempt against the `root` account from a malicious external IP should be treated as a security event.

## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

### Investigation Flow

#### 1. Alert Review

SOC reviewed the Linux alert for unauthorized root access. The alert indicated SSH authentication attempts against the privileged `root` account on `LinFDWebServer04`.

Because root is a highly privileged account, SOC treated the event as suspicious even though the attempts failed.

#### 2. Entity Identification

| Entity           | Value            |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Hostname         | LinFDWebServer04 |
| Host IP          | 10.0.11.8        |
| OS               | Linux - RHEL 8   |
| Targeted Account | root             |
| User Role        | Superuser        |
| Source IP        | 137.74.181.244   |
| Process          | sshd             |
| Executable       | /usr/sbin/sshd   |
| Log Path         | /var/log/secure  |

| Privilege Escalation              | Valid Accounts: Local Accounts | T1078.003 | If successful, root login would provide full privileged access to the Linux host |

**MITRE Note:** Failed root SSH authentication was observed. Successful login, privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration were not observed in the provided logs.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Unauthorized Root SSH Access Attempt / No Successful Login Observed**

The incident is confirmed as a true positive unauthorized root access attempt because a high-risk external IP attempted SSH authentication against the `root` account.

The evidence supporting this conclusion includes:

1. External source IP attempted SSH authentication against `root`.
2. Source IP `137.74.181.244` had **100% abuse confidence**.
3. The source IP belonged to data center / hosting infrastructure.
4. The targeted account was `root`, a privileged superuser account.
5. Both attempts failed.
6. No successful SSH login was observed.

Although the login attempts failed, targeting the root account from a high-risk external IP represents a meaningful security risk and should be monitored closely.

| Residual risk                    | Low after IP block and monitoring |

### Impact Summary

The event involved failed SSH login attempts against the privileged `root` account. Since both attempts failed and no successful login was observed, there is no confirmed compromise from the provided logs. The primary risk was potential unauthorized privileged access if root authentication had succeeded.

### Count SSH Attempts by Source IP and User

```spl id="cs0354_ssh_attempt_count"
index=main sourcetype="linux_logs" hostname="LinFDWebServer04" comm="sshd"
| stats count values(res) as result values(success) as success by addr user hostname
| sort - count
```

### Check Other Hosts Targeted by Same Source IP

```spl id="cs0354_same_source_other_hosts"
index=main sourcetype="linux_logs" addr="137.74.181.244" comm="sshd"
| stats count values(user) as targeted_users values(hostname) as targeted_hosts by addr
| sort - count
```

## Recommended Actions

1. Keep source IP `137.74.181.244` blocked.
2. Confirm direct SSH login for `root` is disabled.
3. Restrict SSH access to approved VPN, jump hosts, or admin IP ranges.
4. Disable password-based SSH authentication where possible.
5. Enforce SSH key-based authentication.
6. Monitor for further root SSH attempts.
7. Review `/var/log/secure` for additional failed or successful authentication events.
8. Review AWS security group rules for SSH exposure.
9. Enable fail2ban or SSH rate limiting if approved.
10. Alert on any successful root login attempt.
11. Review SSH hardening configuration on Linux web servers.
12. Add source IP reputation checks to SSH brute-force detection logic.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No further escalation required after IP block and validation. Escalate only if successful SSH access or additional suspicious activity is identified.**

**Reason:** The incident involved failed SSH attempts against the privileged `root` account. However, both attempts failed, and no successful SSH login or compromise was observed in the provided logs. Blocking the source IP and monitoring the host is sufficient unless further suspicious activity appears.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Linux Team / Incident Response** if:

1. Any successful root login is identified.
2. Failed root attempts continue from other source IPs.
3. Multiple privileged accounts are targeted.
4. Suspicious commands are executed on the host.
5. New users, persistence, or privilege escalation activity is observed.
6. SSH is exposed publicly without restriction.
7. Root login is enabled and cannot be disabled immediately.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-079 — Unauthorized Root Access Attempt** for host `LinFDWebServer04 / 10.0.11.8`. Splunk Linux logs showed failed SSH pre-authentication attempts against the privileged `root` account from source IP `137.74.181.244`. The source IP had **100% abuse confidence** and was associated with **OVH SAS** data center / hosting infrastructure in France. The observed events were generated by `sshd`, executed from `/usr/sbin/sshd`, recorded in `/var/log/secure`, and marked as `success=no` / `res=failed`. No successful root login, account compromise, privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was observed in the provided logs. Source IP `137.74.181.244` was blocked/recommended for blocking, SSH hardening controls were recommended, and the host was monitored for further activity. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Unauthorized Root SSH Access Attempt / Root Login Failed / No Successful Authentication Observed**.
