## Executive Summary

A firewall alert was triggered for **Remote Code Execution** involving inbound traffic from external source IP **14.103.115.234** to internal destination IP **10.0.2.45** on destination port **3389/RDP**.

The destination host is identified as **WinITFileServer1**, a **Windows Server 2019 File Server**. The firewall action was **reset-both**, indicating the session was terminated. Splunk review confirmed **1 RCE event** for the primary alert. No allowed connection, successful RDP session, code execution, compromise, or service impact was confirmed from the provided evidence.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic              | Technique                         | ID    | Reason                                                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Initial Access      | Exploit Public-Facing Application | T1190 | Firewall detected exploit-like RCE traffic toward an exposed remote service |
| Lateral Movement    | Exploitation of Remote Services   | T1210 | RCE attempt targeted RDP/3389 on a Windows server                           |
| Command and Control | Application Layer Protocol        | T1071 | Same source IP was later associated with a Malware C2 firewall alert        |

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Prevented RCE Attempt**

The alert is valid because the firewall detected exploit-like inbound traffic targeting **RDP/3389** on a Windows file server. The source IP has **100% abuse confidence**, and the same source later appeared in a separate **Malware Command & Control** alert.

No successful exploitation is confirmed because the firewall action was **reset-both**, and no endpoint or authentication evidence showed compromise.

## Impact Analysis

| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | No unauthorized access observed                                            |
| Integrity       | No code execution or modification confirmed                                |
| Availability    | No service disruption reported                                             |
| Business Impact | No confirmed impact; elevated concern due to file server and RDP targeting |
| Current Risk    | Reduced because the firewall terminated the session                        |

## Recommended Actions

1. Continue monitoring source IP **14.103.115.234** for repeated activity.
2. Review firewall logs for any allowed traffic from this source.
3. Validate whether RDP/3389 should be externally reachable.
4. Review Windows logs on **10.0.2.45** around **2/1/2025 13:22** for Event IDs **4624**, **4625**, **4776**, and RDP event **1149** if available.
5. Review EDR telemetry for suspicious process execution, exploit indicators, or new services.
6. Add the source IP to a watchlist/blocklist if activity continues, following organizational policy.
7. Escalate if allowed traffic, successful authentication, endpoint alerts, or repeated RCE attempts are observed.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No immediate escalation required; close as True Positive — Prevented.**

**Reason:** The firewall terminated the suspicious RCE session using **reset-both**, and no allowed connection, successful RDP login, compromise, or service impact was observed from the provided evidence.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-08 — Firewall: Remote Code Execution**. Inbound traffic from external source IP **14.103.115.234** to **10.0.2.45 / WinITFileServer1** on **3389/RDP** was detected as Remote Code Execution. Splunk confirmed **1 event** with action **reset-both**. The same source IP was later associated with a blocked Malware Command & Control alert against another internal host. No allowed connection, successful RDP session, endpoint compromise, or service impact was observed. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Prevented**, with continued monitoring recommended.
