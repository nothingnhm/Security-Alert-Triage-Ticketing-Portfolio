## Executive Summary

A firewall alert was triggered for **VPN Login GeoLocation Detected** involving inbound VPN traffic from external source IP **201.172.173.50** to internal VPN server **10.0.2.12 / IvantiVPN01** on **4500/UDP**.

Firewall logs show the traffic was **allowed** and marked with **Geo** context. VPN logs show authentication was initiated for user **priya.verma** using **Password** authentication from an **iOS / iPhone 14 Pro** device, with MFA status **Prompted**. No successful VPN login, MFA approval, internal access, endpoint compromise, or data access was confirmed from the provided evidence.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **Needs Escalation — User Validation Required**

The activity is suspicious due to VPN geolocation context, high source abuse confidence, password-based authentication, MFA prompt generation, and involvement of a Finance user account. However, the logs only confirm **authentication initiated**, not successful login.

This is **not confirmed account compromise** based on the provided evidence. User validation and VPN authentication status review are required before final benign or malicious closure.

## Impact Analysis

| Area            | Assessment                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | No data access observed                                 |
| Integrity       | No unauthorized modification observed                   |
| Availability    | No service disruption reported                          |
| Business Impact | Potentially high if Finance VPN access succeeded        |
| Current Risk    | Medium; successful login and MFA approval not confirmed |

## Recommended Actions

1. Validate whether VPN authentication succeeded, failed, or timed out.
2. Confirm whether MFA was approved, denied, or ignored.
3. Contact **priya.verma** to validate travel/location and device ownership.
4. Review VPN session logs for session start time, duration, and internal access.
5. Check authentication logs for impossible travel, repeated attempts, and new-device activity.
6. Review mailbox activity for suspicious inbox rules, forwarding rules, or sent emails.
7. Review endpoint **ENDP-053** for EDR alerts or phishing indicators.
8. Reset password, revoke sessions, and require MFA re-registration if user denies the activity.
9. Escalate to SOC L2 if successful login, unexpected MFA approval, user denial, or suspicious post-login activity is confirmed.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **User validation required; escalate if suspicious activity is confirmed.**

**Reason:** Firewall and VPN logs confirm suspicious VPN authentication activity, but do not confirm successful VPN login, MFA approval, compromise, or internal access. The ticket should not be closed as benign unless user confirmation and VPN authentication status are validated.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-0199 — Firewall: VPN Login GeoLocation Detected**. Firewall logs show inbound VPN traffic from **201.172.173.50** to **10.0.2.12 / IvantiVPN01** on **4500/UDP**, with action **allowed** and geolocation context observed. VPN logs show authentication initiated for **priya.verma** from an **iOS / iPhone 14 Pro** device, with MFA status **Prompted**. No successful VPN login, MFA approval, internal access, endpoint compromise, or data access was confirmed from the provided evidence. User validation and VPN authentication result review are required; escalate if the user denies the activity or if successful login/MFA approval is confirmed.
