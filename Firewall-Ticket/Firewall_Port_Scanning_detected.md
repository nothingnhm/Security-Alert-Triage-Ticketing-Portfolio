## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

```spl
index=main sourcetype="firewall_logs" srcIP="146.190.48.172"
| stats count by srcIP, dstIP, Action, Protocol, Direction
| sort - count
```

| srcIP          | dstIP     | Action  | Protocol | Direction | Count |
| -------------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | --------- | ----: |
| 146.190.48.172 | 10.0.2.22 | blocked | tcp      | Inbound   |   647 |

**Analysis Note:** Multiple source ports and multiple destination ports were observed, supporting the firewall classification of port scanning behavior. All reviewed events were blocked.

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic         | Technique                 | ID    | Reason                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reconnaissance | Active Scanning           | T1595 | External source performed repeated inbound probing activity          |
| Discovery      | Network Service Discovery | T1046 | Multiple destination ports were scanned to identify exposed services |

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Blocked Reconnaissance Activity**

The alert is valid because firewall and Splunk evidence confirm repeated inbound scanning behavior from **146.190.48.172** toward **10.0.2.22**. The source IP has a high abuse reputation and originates from cloud-hosting infrastructure, increasing the suspicious nature of the activity.

This is assessed as a **blocked external reconnaissance attempt**, not a confirmed compromise.

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | No unauthorized access observed                                               |
| Integrity       | No modification activity observed                                             |
| Availability    | No service disruption reported                                                |
| Business Impact | No confirmed impact; elevated concern due to AD/ADFS-related server targeting |
| Current Risk    | Reduced because all reviewed traffic was blocked                              |

## Recommended Actions

1. Continue monitoring for repeated scanning attempts from **146.190.48.172**.
2. Check whether the same source IP targeted other internal hosts.
3. Review firewall logs for any **allowed** traffic from the same source IP.
4. Validate destination port **3540** against the approved internal service inventory.
5. Confirm whether any scanned ports on **10.0.2.22** are expected to be externally exposed.
6. Consider adding the source IP to a watchlist or blocklist if activity continues, following organizational policy.
7. Escalate if allowed traffic, increased volume, multiple internal targets, or endpoint indicators are observed.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No escalation required; ticket closed as True Positive — Blocked.**

**Reason:** The firewall blocked the observed inbound scanning activity, and Splunk confirmed **647 blocked events**. No allowed traffic, successful connection, compromise, or service impact was identified from the provided evidence.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-07— Firewall: Port Scanning detected**. Inbound TCP traffic from external source IP **146.190.48.172** to internal host **10.0.2.22 / WinITADFS01** was detected as port scanning activity. Splunk review confirmed **647 blocked inbound events**, with multiple source ports and multiple destination ports observed. The source IP has **100% abuse confidence** and is associated with DigitalOcean cloud-hosting infrastructure. No allowed traffic, successful connection, compromise, or service impact was observed. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Blocked**, with continued monitoring recommended.
