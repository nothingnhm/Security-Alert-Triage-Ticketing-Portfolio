| Analyst Decision  | **True Positive — Linux Backup Server Log Forwarding Interruption Confirmed / Resolved** |

## Executive Summary

A system fault alert was triggered because the Linux backup server **LinFDBK02** stopped sending logs to Splunk for more than **60 minutes**.

The affected device is a medium-severity Linux Server with IP address:

`10.0.11.13`

LinFDBK02 functions as a **Backup Server**, so its logs are important for monitoring backup activity, system health, access events, service failures, operational errors, and possible security-related activity.

SOC validated the alert in Splunk and confirmed that logs were not being received from **LinFDBK02** within the expected time window after the reported last log time:

`9/16/2025 11:23`

SOC also validated Splunk infrastructure health, listener port availability, and ingestion status. Other devices continued forwarding logs successfully, confirming that the issue was isolated to **LinFDBK02**.

The case was escalated to the **Linux Team** for endpoint-level validation. The Linux Team restarted the **Splunk Universal Forwarder** service on the affected server. SOC then revalidated Splunk ingestion and confirmed that logs resumed successfully.

Final assessment: **Resolved system fault caused by Splunk Universal Forwarder service failure or unexpected stop on LinFDBK02. No malicious activity, Splunk infrastructure issue, or network-wide outage was identified.**

## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

### Investigation Flow

#### 1. Alert Review

SOC reviewed the automated monitoring alert and confirmed that the alert condition was related to missing logs from **LinFDBK02** for more than 60 minutes.

Because the affected system is a backup server, the alert was important from both operational and security monitoring perspectives. Backup server logs can help identify backup job failures, unauthorized access attempts, system errors, service failures, permission changes, and possible suspicious activity.

#### 2. Asset Identification

| Field                 | Details                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hostname              | LinFDBK02                  |
| IP Address            | 10.0.11.13                 |
| Device Classification | Linux Server               |
| Server Role           | Backup Server              |
| Splunk Index          | main                       |
| Log Forwarding Method | Splunk Universal Forwarder |
| Custodian             | Linux Team                 |
| Asset Severity        | Medium                     |

#### 3. Splunk Evidence Validation

SOC searched Splunk for logs from LinFDBK02:

```spl id="cs0404_host_search"
index=main hostname=LinFDBK02
```

The search confirmed that no new logs were received within the expected time window after the reported LastLogTime. This validated the alert as a genuine log forwarding interruption.

#### 4. Splunk Infrastructure Review

SOC reviewed whether the issue was caused by Splunk server or ingestion issues.

| Component / Check           | Result                |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Splunk server health        | Verified              |
| Splunk ingestion services   | Operational           |
| Listener port 9993          | Up and reachable      |
| Ingestion errors            | Not observed          |
| Queue issues                | Not observed          |
| Other devices               | Actively sending logs |
| Splunk infrastructure issue | Not identified        |

#### 5. Network and Scope Validation

SOC reviewed whether the issue was caused by a wider connectivity problem.

| Check                           | Result                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Network outage                  | Not reported          |
| Connectivity to Splunk receiver | Available             |
| Other hosts sending logs        | Confirmed             |
| Network-wide issue              | Not identified        |
| Endpoint-specific issue         | Confirmed             |
| Final scope                     | Isolated to LinFDBK02 |

The evidence showed that Splunk was healthy and other devices were forwarding logs normally. Therefore, the issue was not caused by Splunk infrastructure or a network-wide outage.

## Endpoint-Level Investigation

SOC escalated the case to the **Linux Team** and requested endpoint-level validation for LinFDBK02.

The Linux Team was asked to validate:

1. Splunk Universal Forwarder service status.
2. Recent maintenance activity.
3. Possible Universal Forwarder service crash.
4. Server CPU, memory, and disk resource status.
5. Disk space or service failure indicators.
6. Connectivity from LinFDBK02 to the Splunk receiver.
7. Whether the Universal Forwarder service required restart.
8. Recent patching or reboot activity.

## Corrective Action

The Linux Team completed endpoint-side remediation and confirmed the following actions:

1. Restarted the Splunk Universal Forwarder service on LinFDBK02.
2. Confirmed no Splunk infrastructure issue was involved.
3. Requested SOC to verify log ingestion after the restart.

## Post-Remediation Verification

SOC rechecked Splunk after remediation using:

```spl id="cs0404_post_remediation"
index=main hostname=LinFDBK02
```

### Verification Outcome

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic | Technique | ID  | Reason                                                                     |
| ------ | --------- | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| N/A    | N/A       | N/A | No malicious activity confirmed                                            |
| N/A    | N/A       | N/A | Incident was caused by system/log forwarding fault, not adversary behavior |

**MITRE Note:** No MITRE ATT&CK mapping is assigned because this was an operational log forwarding issue, not an attack.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Linux Backup Server Not Sending Logs to Splunk**

The alert was valid. LinFDBK02 stopped sending logs to Splunk for more than 60 minutes, and SOC confirmed the log gap through Splunk validation.

The issue was not related to Splunk infrastructure because Splunk services were operational, listener port 9993 was reachable, no ingestion or queue issues were identified, and other devices continued forwarding logs successfully.

The issue was isolated to LinFDBK02 and required Linux Team remediation. No evidence of malicious activity, backup server compromise, unauthorized configuration change, Splunk infrastructure failure, or network-wide outage was identified from the provided evidence.

| Security Impact            | Moderate due to backup server role |

## Recommended Actions

1. Monitor LinFDBK02 log ingestion for the next 24–48 hours.
2. Enable service monitoring for Splunk Universal Forwarder on Linux backup servers.
3. Configure automatic restart recovery for the Splunk Universal Forwarder service.
4. Add LinFDBK02 to a backup server log ingestion health dashboard.
5. Configure missing-log alerts for backup servers after 15–30 minutes.
6. Review Linux system logs for Universal Forwarder service stop/crash events around the outage window.
7. Review recent maintenance, patching, or reboot activity on LinFDBK02.
8. Validate Universal Forwarder configuration persistence after reboot or service restart.
9. Document Universal Forwarder restart and recovery steps in the Linux Team runbook.
10. Perform periodic log source health checks for all backup servers and critical Linux hosts.

## Suggested Splunk Detection Query

```spl id="linux_backup_server_log_gap_detection"
index=main hostname=LinFDBK02
| stats latest(_time) as last_seen by hostname
| eval minutes_since_last_log=round((now()-last_seen)/60,2)
| where minutes_since_last_log > 60
| convert ctime(last_seen)
```

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **Escalated to Linux Team and resolved. No SOC L2 security escalation required.**

**Reason:** SOC confirmed that Splunk infrastructure and general log ingestion were healthy. Since the issue was isolated to the endpoint-side Splunk Universal Forwarder service, the Linux Team was the correct resolver group.

No SOC L2 escalation was required after log ingestion was restored and no compromise indicators were observed.

Escalate further only if:

1. LinFDBK02 stops forwarding logs again.
2. Splunk Universal Forwarder repeatedly fails.
3. Unauthorized configuration changes are identified.
4. Server connectivity becomes unstable.
5. Evidence of backup server tampering or compromise appears.
6. Logs do not resume after Linux Team remediation.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-0404 — System Fault: Device Not Sending Logs to Splunk** after automated monitoring detected that **LinFDBK02** had not sent logs to Splunk for more than 60 minutes. The affected device was identified as a medium-severity Linux Backup Server with IP **10.0.11.13**, using Splunk index `main`, and owned by the **Linux Team**. SOC validated the alert using `index=main hostname=LinFDBK02` and confirmed missing logs within the expected monitoring window after the reported last log timestamp **9/16/2025 11:23**. Splunk server health was verified, listener port **9993** was up and reachable, no ingestion errors or queue issues were observed, and other devices continued forwarding logs successfully. The issue was confirmed as isolated to LinFDBK02 and escalated to the Linux Team for endpoint-side Splunk Universal Forwarder validation. The Linux Team restarted the Splunk Universal Forwarder service. SOC rechecked Splunk and confirmed that logs resumed successfully with new real-time events observed. Ticket closed as **Resolved — Splunk Universal Forwarder Service Stopped Unexpectedly**, with no evidence of Splunk infrastructure failure, network-wide outage, malicious activity, or confirmed permanent data loss.
