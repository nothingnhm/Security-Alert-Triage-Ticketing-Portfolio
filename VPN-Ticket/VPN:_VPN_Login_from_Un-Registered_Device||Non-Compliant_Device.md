| Analyst Decision  | **User Validation Required — Successful VPN Login from Unregistered / Non-Compliant iOS Device** |

## Executive Summary

A VPN security alert was triggered for user **willam.dam** after a successful VPN session was observed from an iOS mobile device:

`iPhone14Pro`

The login originated from the external source IP:

`172.58.20.30`

The alert was generated because the VPN session was started from an **unregistered or non-compliant device**. The user successfully authenticated, completed MFA, and obtained a VPN session with:

`FullAccess`

The VPN destination was:

`10.0.2.12`

The VPN realm was:

`Corporate_VPN`

Splunk logs showed password authentication initiation, MFA challenge generation, successful authentication, active VPN session creation, and later idle timeout due to inactivity. No brute-force pattern, MFA failure, suspicious disconnect reason, or confirmed compromise indicator was observed from the provided logs.

Final assessment: **No confirmed malicious activity was observed, but the login requires user validation and IT/Endpoint compliance review because the VPN session was established from an unregistered/non-compliant iOS device with FullAccess.**

| City            | Dix Hills, New York                  |

### Location and ISP Assessment

The current VPN login originated from a **mobile ISP** in New Orleans, Louisiana, while the user’s usual login source is a **fixed-line ISP** in Dix Hills, New York.

This may be legitimate if the user was travelling or using mobile data. However, because the device was identified as **unregistered/non-compliant**, user validation and device compliance review are required before the event can be fully closed as benign.

**MITRE Assessment:** MITRE mapping is included for investigation reference only. Based on the provided evidence, this incident is not confirmed as malicious. The primary concern is device compliance and access control.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **User Validation Required — Successful VPN Login from Non-Compliant iOS Device**

The VPN login was successful and originated from a mobile iOS device. The main reason for the alert was the use of an **unregistered or non-compliant device**.

The evidence does not strongly indicate malicious activity because:

1. Authentication was successful.
2. MFA was initiated and completed successfully.
3. No incorrect password attempts were observed.
4. No MFA failure was observed.
5. The source IP belongs to a mobile ISP.
6. The session ended due to normal idle timeout.
7. No suspicious disconnect reason was observed.
8. No brute-force pattern was observed.

However, the login still requires validation because:

1. The device was unregistered or non-compliant.
2. The user’s normal login location was different.
3. The VPN session received `FullAccess`.
4. The source IP came from a mobile network in a different state.
5. Unauthorized use of a personal or unmanaged mobile device can create security risk.

Current assessment: **Likely benign if confirmed by user, but policy-related due to non-compliant device access.**

## User Validation Questions

SOC should contact user `willam.dam` and confirm:

1. Did you log in to VPN on `2025-03-25 09:34`?
2. Was the login performed from your mobile phone?
3. Is `iPhone14Pro` your personal or corporate device?
4. Were you located in or near New Orleans, Louisiana during the login?
5. Were you using T-Mobile mobile data?
6. Did you receive and approve the MFA prompt?
7. Did you intentionally access VPN with `FullAccess` role?
8. Is this device registered with IT/MDM?
9. Did you notice any suspicious login notification or account activity?

If the user denies the login, treat the event as possible unauthorized access and start containment.

## Device Compliance Review

Because the alert was related to an unregistered or non-compliant device, IT / Endpoint Management should validate:

1. Whether `iPhone14Pro` is registered in MDM.
2. Whether the device is approved for corporate VPN access.
3. Whether the device meets compliance requirements.
4. Whether the VPN profile is authorized.
5. Whether OS version and security controls meet policy.
6. Whether corporate data was accessed during the VPN session.
7. Whether `FullAccess` should be allowed from mobile devices.
8. Whether conditional access should restrict unmanaged mobile devices.

### Impact Summary

A successful VPN login occurred from an iOS device marked as unregistered or non-compliant. No malicious activity was confirmed from the provided logs. The primary risk is policy and device compliance, especially because the VPN session received `FullAccess`.

## Containment and Remediation

| Scenario                   | Action                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| User confirms login        | Close as benign / policy-related                         |
| User confirms login        | Validate device compliance with IT / MDM team            |
| User confirms login        | Register or enroll device if allowed by policy           |
| User denies login          | Block source IP `172.58.20.30`                           |
| User denies login          | Reset credentials for `willam.dam`                       |
| User denies login          | Terminate any active VPN sessions                        |
| User denies login          | Isolate or review the device if compromise is suspected  |
| Compliance issue confirmed | Restrict VPN access from unmanaged/non-compliant devices |
| Monitoring                 | Add user and device to short-term watchlist              |

## Recommended Actions

1. Contact the user and confirm whether the login was legitimate.
2. Document the user confirmation in the ticket.
3. Validate whether `iPhone14Pro` is a registered and compliant device.
4. Enforce MDM enrollment for mobile devices accessing VPN.
5. Restrict `FullAccess` VPN role from unmanaged mobile devices.
6. Apply conditional access policies for device compliance.
7. Review whether personal mobile devices are allowed for VPN.
8. Monitor `willam.dam` for additional unusual device logins.
9. Block the source IP only if the user denies the login.
10. Reset credentials only if the login was not user-initiated.
11. Isolate or review the device if compromise indicators are identified.
12. Maintain MFA enforcement for all VPN access.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **User validation and IT / Endpoint compliance review required.**

**Reason:** The VPN login was successful and did not show brute-force or failed authentication behavior. However, the login came from an unregistered/non-compliant iOS device and received `FullAccess`, which requires validation against corporate device compliance policy.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Identity / Endpoint Team** if:

1. User denies the login.
2. User reports unexpected MFA prompts.
3. Device is not recognized by the user.
4. Device is not registered or approved for VPN access.
5. Any active VPN session remains open unexpectedly.
6. Suspicious activity is observed after the VPN session.
7. Endpoint or mobile device compromise is suspected.
8. Corporate data access from the session appears abnormal.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-0274 — VPN Login from Un-Registered Device / Non-Compliant Device** for user `willam.dam`. VPN logs showed password authentication initiation from source IP `172.58.20.30` toward destination `10.0.2.12` on VPN device `IvantiVPN01` under realm `Corporate_VPN`. The login was performed from iOS device `iPhone14Pro`, which was identified as unregistered or non-compliant. Splunk evidence confirmed MFA challenge generation, successful authentication, active VPN session creation with `FullAccess`, and idle timeout after 30 minutes. No brute-force activity, MFA failure, suspicious disconnect reason, endpoint compromise, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was observed from the provided logs. User validation and IT/Endpoint device compliance review were recommended. Ticket closed as **User Validation Required — Successful VPN Login from Unregistered / Non-Compliant iOS Device / No Confirmed Malicious Activity**.
