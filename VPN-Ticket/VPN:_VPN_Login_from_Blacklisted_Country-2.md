| Analyst Decision  | **True Positive — Suspicious VPN Login from Blacklisted Country / MFA Prevented Unauthorized Access** |

## Executive Summary

A VPN security alert was triggered for user **rakesh.chauhan** after a VPN authentication attempt was observed from the external source IP:

`185.7.214.37`

The alert was generated because the VPN login originated from a **blacklisted country / high-risk geo-location**. The source IP also had **100% abuse confidence** and was associated with data center / web hosting / transit infrastructure.

The authentication attempt targeted the corporate VPN service:

`Corporate_VPN`

The VPN destination was:

`10.0.2.12`

Splunk VPN logs confirmed password authentication initiation, MFA OTP challenge generation, and MFA failure due to incorrect OTP entry. No successful VPN session was observed.

SOC assessed the activity as a **True Positive suspicious VPN authentication attempt**, likely related to credential abuse, credential stuffing, brute force, or attempted unauthorized VPN access.

Final assessment: **MFA prevented unauthorized access. No successful VPN login, endpoint compromise, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was observed from the provided evidence.**

### Source IP Assessment

The source IP `185.7.214.37` had **100% abuse confidence** and was associated with hosting/transit infrastructure. VPN login attempts from high-risk hosting infrastructure are suspicious, especially when the login targets a valid corporate VPN account.

The activity was treated as a likely credential abuse, brute-force, or credential-stuffing attempt.

## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

### Investigation Flow

#### 1. Alert Review

SOC reviewed the VPN alert for user `rakesh.chauhan`. The alert indicated that VPN authentication was initiated from a source IP associated with a blacklisted country / high-risk region.

Because the attempt involved a valid corporate VPN account, SOC treated the activity as a potential unauthorized access attempt.

#### 2. Entity Identification

**MITRE Note:** Suspicious VPN authentication and MFA challenge generation were observed. Successful VPN access, MFA bypass, endpoint compromise, lateral movement, and data exfiltration were not observed.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Suspicious VPN Login from Blacklisted Country / No Successful Login**

The alert is valid because VPN authentication was initiated from a blacklisted/high-risk source IP with **100% abuse confidence**.

The login attempt targeted a valid corporate VPN user account and reached the MFA stage. MFA failed due to incorrect OTP entry, which prevented unauthorized access.

The activity is consistent with:

1. Credential-stuffing attempt.
2. Password brute-force attempt.
3. Attempted use of exposed credentials.
4. Unauthorized VPN login attempt.
5. Use of high-risk hosting infrastructure to attempt access.

No successful VPN session was established.

1. Keep source IP `185.7.214.37` blocked on VPN/firewall controls.
2. Reset credentials for user `rakesh.chauhan`.
3. Revoke any active VPN sessions for the affected user.
4. Monitor `rakesh.chauhan` for additional failed or successful VPN attempts.
5. Review VPN logs for the same source IP targeting other users.
6. Review VPN logs for successful sessions from the same source IP.
7. Enforce account lockout or rate limiting for repeated VPN failures.
8. Keep MFA mandatory for all VPN access.
9. Review conditional access policies for risky IP reputation and blacklisted geographies.
10. Add high-abuse hosting IPs to VPN denylist after validation.
11. Educate the user about phishing, credential reuse, and unexpected MFA prompts.
12. Monitor for authentication attempts from related IP ranges or the same hosting provider.

## User Validation Questions

SOC should contact user `rakesh.chauhan` and confirm:

1. Were you attempting to log in to VPN at `2025-01-29 11:30`?
2. Were you using any third-party VPN, proxy, or privacy service?
3. Were you travelling or working from an unusual location?
4. Did you receive an unexpected OTP or MFA notification?
5. Did you approve, reject, or ignore any MFA prompt?
6. Did you recently enter your corporate credentials on any suspicious website?
7. Is `MAC-12432` your assigned device?
8. Did you notice any suspicious activity on your Mac device?

If the user confirms the activity was not initiated by them, the credential reset and source IP block should remain enforced.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No further escalation required after containment, unless new suspicious activity is identified.**

**Reason:** The login attempt came from a blacklisted/high-risk source and targeted a valid corporate VPN account. MFA blocked the attempt, and no successful VPN session, endpoint compromise, lateral movement, or data loss was observed.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Identity Team / Endpoint Security** if any of the following occur:

1. Successful VPN login from the suspicious IP.
2. MFA approval from an unknown source.
3. Multiple users are targeted by the same source IP.
4. Repeated attempts continue after IP block.
5. User confirms the activity was not initiated by them and reports suspicious device behavior.
6. Suspicious mailbox, endpoint, or cloud activity appears.
7. Evidence of credential theft is identified.
8. Endpoint compromise indicators are found on `MAC-12432`.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-0270 — VPN Login from Blacklisted Country** for user `rakesh.chauhan`. VPN logs showed password authentication initiation from source IP `185.7.214.37` toward destination `10.0.2.12` on VPN device `IvantiVPN01` under realm `Corporate_VPN`. The alert triggered because the login originated from a blacklisted/high-risk region. Source IP `185.7.214.37` had **100% abuse confidence** and was associated with data center / web hosting / transit infrastructure. Splunk evidence confirmed authentication initiation, MFA OTP challenge generation, and MFA failure due to incorrect OTP. No successful VPN session, MFA bypass, endpoint compromise, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was observed. Source IP blocking, user credential reset, user validation, and continued monitoring were completed/recommended. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Suspicious VPN Login from Blacklisted Country / MFA Prevented Unauthorized Access / No Confirmed Compromise**.
