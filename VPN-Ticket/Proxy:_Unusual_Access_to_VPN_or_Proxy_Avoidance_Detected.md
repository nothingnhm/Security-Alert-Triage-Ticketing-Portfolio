## Executive Summary

A proxy alert was triggered for **Unusual Access to VPN or Proxy Avoidance** involving access to **aproxy.com**, categorized as **Proxy Avoidance**.

The observed URL was:

`https://aproxy.com/?device=c&keyword=aproxy&gad_source=1`

The proxy action was **Allowed**, HTTP method was **GET**, and response code was **200**, confirming the site was successfully accessed. Additional proxy logs show user **Daniel Nair** from source IP **10.1.2.44 / ENDP-219** accessed the AProxy website from a Google search referrer and then accessed the AProxy login page.

This activity is a **true positive policy violation / risky proxy avoidance access** because proxy avoidance services may be used to bypass corporate web filtering, monitoring, and security controls.

No malware download, endpoint compromise, data exfiltration, or confirmed malicious activity was identified from the provided logs.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — Proxy Avoidance Access**

The alert is valid because proxy logs confirm access to **aproxy.com**, categorized as **Proxy Avoidance**. The user also reached the proxy service login page, which increases concern that the service may have been used or intended for use.

This is **not confirmed endpoint compromise**. No malware download, credential exposure, data exfiltration, suspicious payload, or endpoint compromise evidence was provided.

## Impact Analysis

| Area            | Assessment                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confidentiality | No data leakage confirmed                                  |
| Integrity       | No endpoint modification confirmed                         |
| Availability    | No service impact reported                                 |
| Policy Impact   | Proxy avoidance access detected on corporate endpoint      |
| Current Risk    | Medium due to successful access to proxy avoidance service |

## Recommended Actions

1. Contact **Daniel Nair** to confirm the business reason for accessing **aproxy.com**.
2. Confirm whether the user logged in to the AProxy service.
3. Confirm whether the proxy service was used to access any restricted or risky websites.
4. Confirm whether any corporate credentials or sensitive data were entered into the proxy service.
5. Review browser history after the AProxy access.
6. Check endpoint **ENDP-219** for downloads, suspicious browser activity, or EDR/AV alerts.
7. Block **aproxy.com** in proxy/DNS security controls.
8. Block destination IP **203.0.219.120** if no business requirement exists.
9. Enforce blocking for the **Proxy Avoidance** web category by default.
10. Escalate only if the proxy service was used for malicious browsing, credential entry, data transfer, malware download, or repeated policy violation.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No immediate SOC L2 escalation required; close after user validation and blocking.**

**Reason:** The logs confirm proxy avoidance access, but no malware download, endpoint compromise, data exfiltration, or malicious follow-up activity was confirmed. This should be handled as a policy/security control violation unless additional impact is found.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-040 — Proxy: Unusual Access to VPN or Proxy Avoidance Detected**. Proxy logs show user **Daniel Nair** from **10.1.2.44 / ENDP-219** accessed **aproxy.com**, categorized as **Proxy Avoidance**.

No malware download, endpoint compromise, data exfiltration, or confirmed malicious activity was observed from the provided logs. Ticket closed as **True Positive — Proxy Avoidance Policy Violation / No Confirmed Compromise**, with user validation, domain/IP blocking, and Proxy Avoidance category enforcement recommended.
