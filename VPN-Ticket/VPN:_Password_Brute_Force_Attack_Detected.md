| Analyst Decision  | **True Positive — VPN Brute Force Attempt / MFA Prevented Unauthorized Access** |

## Executive Summary

A VPN brute-force alert was triggered for user **ajay.malhotra** after repeated authentication attempts were observed against the corporate VPN service.

All attempts originated from the external source IP:

`103.91.136.18`

The authentication attempts targeted the VPN destination:

`10.0.2.12`

The affected VPN realm was:

`Corporate_VPN`

Splunk VPN logs showed repeated password authentication initiation events followed by MFA OTP challenges. Multiple MFA failures were recorded because incorrect OTP values were entered. No successful VPN session was observed in the provided evidence.

Source IP reputation showed **100% abuse confidence**, making the source highly suspicious. The activity is consistent with a VPN brute-force or credential-stuffing attempt against a valid user account.

Final assessment: **True Positive VPN brute-force attempt. MFA prevented unauthorized access, and no confirmed VPN compromise was observed.**

## SIEM / Splunk Analysis

### Investigation Flow

#### 1. Alert Review

SOC reviewed the VPN brute-force alert for user `ajay.malhotra`. The alert indicated authentication activity from external source IP `103.91.136.18` against the corporate VPN.

The activity was suspicious because the same user account was repeatedly targeted, MFA challenges were generated, and multiple MFA failures were observed.

| Initial Access    | Valid Accounts                                 | T1078 | A valid user account was targeted against the corporate VPN; successful access was not confirmed |

| Initial Access    | External Remote Services                       | T1133 | VPN service was targeted as an external remote access service                                    |

**MITRE Note:** Brute-force activity and MFA challenge generation were observed. Successful VPN access, MFA bypass, lateral movement, endpoint compromise, and data exfiltration were not observed.

## Analyst Assessment

**Assessment:** **True Positive — VPN Brute Force Attempt / No Successful Login**

The alert is valid because multiple VPN authentication attempts were observed against the same user account from a suspicious external IP with **100% abuse confidence**.

The activity is consistent with a VPN brute-force or credential-stuffing attempt. MFA prevented the attacker from completing authentication, and no successful VPN session was identified in the provided logs.

The possibility of password exposure cannot be fully ruled out because the authentication flow reached MFA challenge stages. For this reason, user credential reset and account monitoring were appropriate containment actions.

| Business impact         | Low                           |
| Security impact         | Limited due to MFA protection |

## Recommended Actions

1. Keep source IP `103.91.136.18` blocked on VPN/firewall controls.
2. Reset the password for user `ajay.malhotra`.
3. Revoke any active VPN sessions for the affected user.
4. Review VPN logs for successful sessions from the same source IP.
5. Review VPN logs for the same source IP targeting other users.
6. Monitor `ajay.malhotra` for additional failed login attempts.
7. Monitor for login attempts from related IP ranges or the same ISP.
8. Keep MFA enforced for all VPN users.
9. Review conditional access or VPN access policies for high-abuse IPs.
10. Enable account lockout or rate limiting for repeated VPN failures.
11. Educate the user about phishing, credential reuse, and unexpected MFA prompts.
12. Add source IP, user, and VPN realm to SIEM watchlists for short-term monitoring.

| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| VPN / Firewall | Block source IP `103.91.136.18`                     |
| Identity       | Reset user credentials for `ajay.malhotra`          |
| VPN            | Confirm no active session from suspicious IP        |
| MFA            | Confirm MFA prevented unauthorized access           |
| SIEM           | Add source IP and user to monitoring/watchlist      |
| SOC            | Monitor for repeated attempts against same user     |
| SOC            | Monitor for similar attempts from related IP ranges |

## User Validation Questions

SOC should contact user `ajay.malhotra` and confirm:

1. Were you attempting to log in to VPN around `2025-03-16 17:11–17:27`?
2. Did you receive unexpected OTP or MFA notifications?
3. Did you approve, reject, or ignore any MFA prompt?
4. Did you recently enter your password on any suspicious website?
5. Have you reused this password on any external website?
6. Did you notice any suspicious activity on your account or endpoint?
7. Were you located near the source IP region at the time of the attempts?

If the user confirms the activity was not initiated by them, the password reset and IP block should remain enforced.

## Escalation Decision

**Decision:** **No further escalation required after containment.**

**Reason:** The incident was confirmed as a VPN brute-force attempt, but MFA prevented unauthorized access. No successful VPN session, MFA bypass, endpoint compromise, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was observed in the provided logs.

Escalate to **SOC L2 / Identity Team** if any of the following are identified:

1. Successful VPN login from suspicious IP.
2. MFA approval from unknown source.
3. Multiple users targeted by the same source IP.
4. Repeated attempts continue after IP block.
5. Suspicious mailbox, endpoint, or cloud activity appears.
6. Evidence of credential theft is identified.
7. User confirms the login attempts were not legitimate and additional suspicious activity is found.

## Final Ticket Closure Comment

SOC investigated ticket **CS-0264 — VPN Password Brute Force Attack Detected** for user `ajay.malhotra`. VPN logs showed repeated password authentication initiation from external source IP `103.91.136.18` toward VPN destination `10.0.2.12` on VPN device `IvantiVPN01` under realm `Corporate_VPN`. The activity generated multiple MFA OTP challenges, followed by repeated MFA failures due to incorrect OTP entries. The source IP had **100% abuse confidence**, and the pattern was consistent with a brute-force or credential-stuffing attempt against a valid VPN account. No successful VPN session, MFA bypass, endpoint compromise, lateral movement, or data exfiltration was observed. Source IP `103.91.136.18` was blocked, user credentials for `ajay.malhotra` were reset, and continued monitoring was recommended. Ticket closed as **True Positive — VPN Brute Force Attempt / MFA Prevented Unauthorized Access / No Confirmed Compromise**.
